####About me
I'm amazingly creative person. So that why I do think IT sphere is perfect way to express myself and to feel a new burden of responsibility and to get commercial web development experience. I do understand the challenges at the first days of work with in a team - you need to becom fammiliar with teammates and be able to communicate with no doubt. I generally do my best to solve the issues by myself but I do not hesitate to ask colleagues for help.

####Work experiences
- I have experience of independent work on JavaScript. I study it in my free time and practice on test tasks.

- I do layout and use the BEM methodology, because I like the code to be organized (by virtue of my capabilities).

- I recently switched to the React framework and succesfully continue to study it. In future, I plan to try out ReactNative.

- I have not encountered the server part, but there is a desire to gain experience with NodeJS or .NET applications
